								<h2>Student in 235</h2> 



<p>Welcome to my website!  Just a little about me: I was born in Oakland, CA and moved to NH after around 6 months.  Since then I have lived in Manchester NH and I definitely consider there my home!  My hobbies include mainly hanging out with my friends, I have a great group of buds and no matter what we do, it's always a good time.  I also am a big fan of hiking, and I absolutely love climbing rocky trails.  I enjoy being outside and I love to play sports.  In fact I played basketball most my life (even though I was told I would better be suited for football haha) and I played up through sophomore year of high school.
