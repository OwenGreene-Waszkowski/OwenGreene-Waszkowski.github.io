							<h1>Hiking Katahdin</h1>
							
<p>As I said in my first page, I'm a huge fan of rock climbing.  That's why, when a friend 
of mine brought up hiking Katahdin to me, i knew i had to jump at the opportunity.  Standing
at 5,269' it was by far the hardest climb I had ever gone through.  Especially at the end!  
Almost a sheer vertical climb towards the finish, with there being no grass, just rocks, 
rocks, and more rocks!  I was EXHAUSTED at the end!  However, what I saw along my path up 
was enough to make me forget all about the soreness in my legs.  It was absolutely stunning
that's the only way to describe it and even then I can't do it justice.  It was one of the
best experiences of my life just seeing how absolutely beautiful the world could be.  Now
without further ado, I should show you what I'm talking about!  But just remember, pictures
can't even do it justice, it's 10x more breathtaking in person...that I can promise.
