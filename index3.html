							<h1>More About Me!</h1>
							


<p>As much as I like being outdoors and spending time climbing, playing basketball, etc, 
there's one other thing that I very much enjoy doing with my time!  Gaming!  Now whereas
almost anyone can claim that they are a gamer, i have something that definitely sets me 
apart from other individuals.  I'm signed to a contract!  Yes, you did hear that right!
I play a game called critical ops which I will link down below.  It's pretty much a mobile 
version of CSGO or Counterstrike Global Offensive, a game that has exploded across the 
country in the past couple of years.  Now obviously a LOT smaller than Counterstrike 
Critical Ops has a lot of growing to do!  I've been playing for just about a year now, and 
it was only recently that "organizations" or mass powerhouses that fund/sponsor teams 
started joining the community.  In fact until quite recently Gankstars (who I play for)
was one of the only ones in the game.  Gankstars is pretty big, they have teams in 5 games
and are very well known around the community.  They have just around 35,000 followers on 
twitter, and are definitely one of the bigger orgs in the scene.  However recently bigger
and bigger orgs are starting to flock to Critical ops as it grows more and more.  The
game itself is growing at a very rapid pace, with tournaments not even a year ago, 
offering no monetary prize, and now there are tournaments with the winners receiving 
10,000 dollars!  It makes me very proud to have stayed by this game since it was released,
almost as if I was a parent watching my child grow.  Playing the game is something I have 
loved ever since I started, and now I'm earning money for something I love to do!  I can't
wait for it to keep growing and growing, for surely it will explode very soon, and when it 
does, many investors and organizations are going to pay a lot of attention to it!  So 
definitely looking forward to that happening very soon!
