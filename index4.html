							       <h1>Gankstars!</h1>

<p>							       
I had to include this page on my pages because i am super proud of this organization
and everything we've accomplished.  Since they have come into the Critical Ops Competitive
scene, the team has won around $20000 in total from tournaments.  They were one of the 
first people to put their trust in this little mobile game and look where it's gotten them!

With Critical Ops growing larger and larger, Gankstars has already established themselves
as one of the main powerhouses of the game.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say 
they're excited to see which ways this game goes..and which new ways Gankstars rise up!
