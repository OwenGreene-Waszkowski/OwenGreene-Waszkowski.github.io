								<h1> Wrapping It Up! </h1>


<p>
At the beginning of this project I thought this was going to be terrible.  I thought to 
myself how am I going to get FIVE pages of this done?  Now, here I am typing up the last
page, and to be honest I don't think I've had more fun on an assignment in quite a long 
time.  Whereas coding may be quite annoying at points, even frustrating, once i got 
the hang of it, I had a lot of fun just figuring out the different things I could do.
Moving pictures, learning a lot more css to make my pages look better, it was all quite
interesting and enjoyable to learn!  Who knows?  Maybe I'll pursue more of this in the 
future!!
